BP_Block
- Loosen Block (reset rotation y & z, reset location x, set scale 0.98, set sim physics true, enable collision)
- Fasten Block (set scale 1, set sim physics false)
- EnableCollision (Enable collision of block mesh)
- DisableCollsion (Disable collsion of block mesh)


BP_BlockSlot
- Validate Attached (validate block ref is attached to attach point)
- Release Block (ValidateAttached, Detach from actor, LoosenBlock/ , Call OnBlockReleased)
- Add Block (ValidateAttached, Attach block to attach point, Block->FastenBlock, EnableCollision/DisableCollsion, Call OnBlockAdded, Call MoveBlockToSlot)
- IsFree (ValidateAttached, Return boolean)
- OnComponentBeginOverlap ()
- MoveBlockToSlot(Event) (Block->DisableCollsion, Play Timeline_0, )
- Timeline_0 (Update) - (Lerp Block->SetActorPosition, Lerp Block->SetActorRotation)
- Timeline_0 (Finished) - (Block->EnableCollision/Block->DisableCollsion)





- Block smaller (carry in hands)
- BlockSlot - Make moveslot use shortest to side instead of actor location
- Scale all to 1/10 for limit high mass object (To prevent physics constraint stretch under high mass)
x One blockslot platform back and forth on chain(cosmetic chain)



- Trace for block pickup from character location
- Pickup/Set dowm blocks better
- Make new meshes for 70cm grid





Tech progression:
- Rails for push cart
- Rails for mechinal cart
- Chain pull system
- Tube force system
