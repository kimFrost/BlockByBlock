25.1.17: 
 - Railtrack update spline function for cart

 
 
Backlog -----------------------------
 - Sensor component - With events (OnSensoredBlock, OnSensoredPlayer)
 - Sphere trace for put down block on near blockSlot.
 - Gamemode world grid (Copy from space katana)
 - BlockSlot - Make moveslot use shortest to side instead of actor location
 - Player place blocks as fastened. 
 - Stack blocks on each other
 - Physic drag handle for cart and various object, for pull and push cart, crates etc.
 - Rope to pull/drag cart
 
 
 
Ideas ----------------------
 - The main character is mechanical based as well. A player can insert himself into contraptions to power and control/drive them.
